Some modifications were made to the music track to make it loop better:
a) The silence before the start of the track, at 0:00.00000 to 0:00.12525 of the original track, was cut off.
b) Part of the music that did not loop well was cut off. The part starting at 3:10.36823 sets a different, more tranquil, mood, which culminates in the end of the track, starting at 4:38.16775 where the tempo is slower. Everything past 3:10.36823 of the original track was cut off.
c) The note starting at 3:10.13370 and ending at 3:10.25105 of the original track was pitch-shifted one octave up to continue a pattern first observed at 0:07.21315.
